"John has 3 boxes. Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick. What is the total inner volume of all 3 boxes?
Answer:
The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
    So each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width
    It also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height
    Finally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth
    So the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches
    So in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches

"John has 3 boxes. Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick. What is the total inner volume of all 3 boxes?
Answer:
The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
    So each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width
    It also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height

Question: John has 3 boxes. Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick.
What is the total inner volume of all 3 boxes?
Solution:
The walls subtract a (1 + 1) = 2 inches from each dimension. So, each box has a reduced width of (5 - 2) = 3 inches, reduced length of (6 - 2) = 4 inches and reduced height of (4 - 2) = 2 inches. 
So the inner volume of each box is 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches. 
The total inner volume of 3 boxes are 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches.
Alternative Step by Step Solution:","The total volume of each box = 5 * 6 * 4 = 120 cubic inches. The cube has 6  surfaces where a certain volume contributes to the wall volume. 
The wall volume corresponding to the (width, length) surface =  2 * (2  * (5 + 6) - 4) = 36 cubic inches. 
The wall volume corresponding to the (width, height) surface =  2 * (2  * (5 + 4) - 4) = 28 cubic inches.
The wall volume corresponding to the (height, length) surface =  2 * (2  * (4 + 6) - 4) = 32 cubic inches.
Hence, the iner volume of each box = 120 - 36 - 28- 32 = 24 cubic inches.
The total inner volume of 3 boxes = 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches. "

An economic seer predicts that in the next lunar phase, the gems will increase in value due to a Meldorean Shift Factor of 2.5, and the smart gadgets by a factor of 1.2. In this universe, a Meldorean Shift translates to logistic growth in our world, following the formula:

Y = \frac{L}{1 + e^{-k(X-X_0)}}

Where:
- Y is the predicted value after growth.
- L is the carrying capacity, set as twice the original value of the item. For gems, L = 2 * 5000 = 10000, and for smart gadgets, L = 2 * 8000 = 16000.
- e is the base of the natural logarithm.
- k is the growth rate, which is the Meldorean Shift Factor. For gems, k = 2.5, and for smart gadgets, k = 1.2.
- X is the current time period, which is 1 lunar phase, so X = 1.
- X_0 is the midpoint of the growth curve, which is 0 in this scenario, so X_0 = 0.

Answer:
The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
        If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
        So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
        And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
        So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

Answer:
First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.

Answer:
First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes. Of those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 – 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances. Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.

Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.
